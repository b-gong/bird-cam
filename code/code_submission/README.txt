The atmega folder includes the code flashed onto the ATMega328p. It includes 4 custom libraries and two "main" files. One is main.c, intended for actual usage of the product. The other is demo_no_rtc.c, which has all the functions trigger based off of load cell detection. This is for demonstration purposes, especially of functions that typically only run at certain times in the day.

The esp32 folder contains just esp32.ino, an Arduino IDE code file for the ESP32-CAM.
